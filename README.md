# Lab6-3D-from-stereo-II

Python code and lab sheet for lab class 6 on stereo. Details on how to run the code are as for Lab5-3D-from-stereo-I and the lab tasks can be found in the lab sheet IPCV-Lab2-22-23.pdf.

The code follows on from that used in Lab 5. As for that lab, download the repository and try v1 and v2. If neither work, contact a TA.
